# Registering Datafiles and Samples on IBISBAHub

## Part 1: Registering/Uploading Datafiles

### Step 1: Download Required Datafiles
Download the datafiles provided in the [IBISBA_WorkShop_Material](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KxoQoFv-WPiozKrlJCl68Oh72u6ROdN5?usp=sharing):
1. MassSpec_Results.xls
2. ProteinModelReannotation.doc

### Step 2: Create a New Datafile Entry
Assuming you are already logged in, click the "*Create*" button from the top-navigation bar and from the drop-down menu select "*datafile*". A new page will open up.

Upload datafile (1.MassSpec_Results.xls)

*Note: You can also register a Data file by registering a URL to either another page or remote file.*

### Step 3: Enter Datafile Metadata
Fill in the sections using the following information:

#### Title
*Proteins detected by high-throughput mass spectrometry of secretome Aspergillus Niger*

#### Description
*Secretome enriched fractions of A. niger N402 cultured under controlled conditions in defined synthetic media were analysed by high-throughput mass spectrometry*

#### Projects
Assign this datafile to the project to which it belongs:
- *\<Your Name\> Project: An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome*

#### Tags
Add some tags to the datafile which will help to describe it, For example: Mass Spec Data

Click "*NEXT*".

### Step 4: License and Permissions

#### License
From the list choose "*Creative Common License*"

#### Sharing Policy
Choose "*No access*" if you wish to keep the datafile private

Click "*NEXT*".

#### Associated Assays
Associate this datafile to the ASSAY: "*Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry*" from the list

*You can also select an existing Experimental assay or Modelling analysis to associate with this Data file.*

Click "*NEXT*".

On this page you can add additional properties to the datafile such as:
- Associate it with other datafiles
- Add associated publications
- Events related to this datafile

Hit the "*Create*" button.

### Optional Steps After Creating Datafile
Once the datafile is created, using the "*Actions*" drop down menu you can:
- Edit this file
- Manage the file
- Delete the file
- Upload a new version

Using the "*Explore*" button you can:
- View the contents of the file
- Plot the data
- Add annotation

## Part 2: Sample Registration

### Step 1: Download Sample File
Download the file "*3.Samples_A.Niger.xlsx*" from the [IBISBA_WorkShop_Material](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KxoQoFv-WPiozKrlJCl68Oh72u6ROdN5?usp=sharing)

### Step 2: Create a New Datafile Entry
Assuming you are already logged in, click the *Create* button from the top-navigation bar and from the drop-down menu select "*datafile*". A new page will open up.

Upload datafile (3.Samples_A.Niger.xlsx)

### Step 3: Enter Sample File Metadata
Fill in the sections using the following information:

#### Title
*Samples used for the Aspergillus Niger experiments*

#### Description
*Secretome enriched fractions of A. niger cultured under controlled conditions in defined synthetic media and analysed by high-throughput mass spectrometry*

#### Projects
Assign this datafile to the project to which it belongs:
- *\<Your Name\> Project: An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome*

Press "*NEXT*".

### Step 4: License and Permissions

#### License
From the list choose "*Creative Common License*"

#### Sharing Policy
Choose "*No access*" if you wish to keep the datafile private

#### Associated Assays
Since the Samples belong to the entire project you **DO NOT** need to assign the file to an **ASSAY**

Click "*NEXT*"

On this page you can add additional properties to the datafile such as:
- Associate it with other datafiles
- Add associated publications
- Events related to this datafile

Hit the "*Create*" button.

### Step 5: Extract Samples
From the top panel of options click "*Extract Samples*" and you will be directed to a new page.

### Step 6: Select Sample Type
Select "*Sample Type*" from the list and click "*Continue*". It will take a few moments to extract the Samples.

### Step 7: Review Extracted Data
Click on the "*Review Extracted Samples*" and check whether the data looks right to you.

### Step 8: Confirm Extraction
Press "*Confirm*" and the samples will be assigned to your Project.

### Optional Steps After Creating Sample Entry
Once the datafile is created, using the "*Actions*" drop down menu you can:
- Edit this file
- Manage the file
- Delete the file
- Upload a new version

Using the "*Explore*" button you can:
- View the contents of the file
- Plot the data
- Add annotation
