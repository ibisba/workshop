#  Registering Datafiles and Samples

## PART1: Registering/Uploading datafiles

**Step1:**  Download the datafiles provided in the [IBISBA\_WorkShop\_Material](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KxoQoFv-WPiozKrlJCl68Oh72u6ROdN5?usp=sharing) :

- 1.MassSpec\_Results.xls
- 2.ProteinModelReannotation.doc

**Step2:**  Assuming you are already logged in click the “*Create”* button from the top-navigation bar and from the drop-down menu select “*datafile*” and a new page will open up:

- Upload datafile(1.MassSpec\_Results.xls)

You can also register a Data file by registering a URL to either another page or remote file


**Step3:** Fill in the sections using the following information:

**Title:** *Proteins detected by high-throughput mass spectrometry of secretome Aspergillus Niger*

**Description:** *Secretome enriched fractions of A. niger N402 cultured under controlled conditions in defined synthetic media were analysed by high-throughput mass spectrometry*

**Projects:** Assign this datafile to the project to which it belongs

* Project : An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome*

**Tags:** Add some tag to the datafile which will help to describe it, For e.g. *Mass Spec Data

> Click “*Next*”


**Step4:**  License and Permissions

**License:** From the list choose “*Creative Common License*”

**Sharing Policy:**  Choose “*No access*” if you wish to keep the datafile private

> Click “*Next*"

**Associated Assays:**

Associated this datafile to the ASSAY :“*Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry*” from the list
You can also select an existing Experimental assay or Modelling analysis to associate with this Data file.

> Click “*Next*”

On this page you add additional properties to the datafile such as:

- Associate it with other datafiles
- Add associated publications
- Events related to this datafile
 
> Hit the “*Create*” button.

**Optional Steps:**

Once the datafile is created, using the “*Actions”* drop down menu you can

- edit this file
- manage the file
- delete the file or
- upload a new version

 
**Using the “*Explore”* button you can:**

- view the contents of the file
- plot the data
- add annotation

## PART2: Sample Registration

To register Samples we have to create *Sample Types. Sample Types*  are templates that detail the key information that needs to be included to describe a given sample correctly.

A Sample Type can be made in two ways:

- By manually defining the attributes using a form
- Uploading a spreadsheet that contains a Sample Template
- Using the [FAIR Data Station](https://fairds.fairbydesign.nl)

In this section  we will be creating Samples using a spreadsheet containing the Sample Type Template

**Step1:**

Download the file “*3.Samples\_A.Niger.xlsx*” from the [IBISBA\_WorkShop\_Material](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KxoQoFv-WPiozKrlJCl68Oh72u6ROdN5?usp=sharing)

**Step2:**

Assuming you are already logged in click the *Create* button from the top-navigation bar and from the drop-down menu select “*Sample Types*” and a new page  *New Sample Type* will open up:

**Choose the tab Use spreadsheet template**

**Step3:**

Fill in the sections using the following information:

**Title:** *Samples used for the Aspergillus Niger experiments*

**Description:** *Secretome enriched fractions of A. niger cultured under controlled conditions in defined synthetic media and analysed by high-throughput mass spectrometry*

**Projects:** Assign to the project to which it belongs:

- * Project: An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome*

**Step4:** Permissions and template Upload

### Sharing Policy

Choose “*No access*” if you wish to keep the datafile private

*Click* “*File to Upload” : 3.Samples\_A.Niger.xlsx* and then

> Hit the “*Create*” button

From here you will be taken to a page containing the metadata, and a list of the attribute names from the template file.
Here you can select specific attribute types. You are also free to delete, rename or reorder the attributes.

**Step5:** Once Step 4 is completed  click update. Your Sample Type can now be used to generate Samples.

## Optional Steps:

Once the datafile is created, using the “*Actions”* drop down menu you can

- Edit Sample Type 
- Manage Sample Type
- Delete Sample Type

**Step6:** 

From here you can now create your samples using the 
> "*Create sample*" button in the top menu

You’ll be directed to a *New Sample* page. Where you can add the following information:

**Sample Name:**
**Strain:**
**Type:**

**Projects:** Assign the Sample to the project to which it belongs:

- * Project: An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome*

**Permissions and template Upload**

**Sharing Policy:** Choose “*No access*” if you wish to keep the datafile private

**Creators:**

**Observation Unit:**

> Hit the “*Create*” button

## Creating Samples from a template

You can bulk-create samples by populating a template and uploading as a Datafile. Once uploaded it should be recognised as having originated from a sample type template, and an option to extract samples will be displayed as a button.

**Step1:**

Download the file “*3.Samples\_A.Niger.xlsx*” from the [IBISBA\_WorkShop\_Material](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KxoQoFv-WPiozKrlJCl68Oh72u6ROdN5?usp=sharing)

**Step2:**  Assuming you are already logged in click the *Create* button from the top-navigation bar and from the drop-down menu select “*datafile*” and a new page will open up:
      Upload datafile(3.Samples\_A.Niger.xlsx)


**Step3:** 

Fill in the sections using the following information:

**Title:** *Samples used for the Aspergillus Niger experiments*

**Description:** *Secretome enriched fractions of A. niger cultured under controlled conditions in defined synthetic media and analysed by high-throughput mass spectrometry*

**Projects:** Assign this datafile to the project to which it belongs:

- * Project: An inventory of Aspergillus niger secrotome*

> Click “*Next*" 

**Step4:**   License and Permissions

**License:** From the list choose “*Creative Common License*”

**Sharing Policy:** Choose “*No access*” if you wish to keep the datafile private

> Click “*Next”*

**Associated Assays:** Choose the existing assay to which the Sample belongs

> Click “*Next”*

On this page you can add additional properties to the datafile such as

- Associate it with Discussion Channels
- Add associated publications
- Events related to this datafile
- Associated Observations Units

> Hit the “*Create*” button

**Step5:** From the top panel of options click “*Extract Samples*” and you will be directed to a new page

**Step6:** Select “*Sample Type”* from the list and click “*Continue”*. It will take a few moments to extract the Samples

**Step7:** 

> Click on the “*Review Extracted Samples*” and  check whether the data looks right to you

**Step8:** 

> Click “*Confirm*” button and the samples will be assigned to your Project

Using the “*Explore”* button you can:

- view the contents of the file
- plot the data
- add annotation

### Optional Steps

Once the datafile is created, using the “*Actions”* drop down menu you can

- edit this file
- manage the file
- delete the file or
- Register new version
