# Populating Your Project on IBISBAHub

## Purpose

At the end of this section, you will know how to:
- Define a spreadsheet for a project's ISA tree
- Upload it to a project
- Populate the project
- Alter parts of the ISA tree

## Context

The tree structure of Investigation -> Study -> Assay (ISA) can be created individually in the IBISBAHub interface. However, it is often easier to specify the entire tree in a single document.

## Steps

### Step 1: Understanding the Template

IBISBAHub allows an Excel spreadsheet to represent the tree. The spreadsheets must follow the IBISBA template. You can view the template on the Google Drive [population-template.xlsx](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18mFA8lpq2925U6UzrLUBSNRLzIDRJatq/view?usp=sharing).

The population template has columns for the Investigation, Study and Assay.

A realistic example of a population file that conforms to the template can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17w-PbR7cPH_I22wBDHQ9Is3eTv_kgAX2/view?usp=sharing).

This corresponds to the ISA hierarchy for this [project](https://sandbox8.fairdomhub.org/projects/8).

### Step 2: Preparing Your Spreadsheet

#### Step 2a:
In this training, we will be using a simpler spreadsheet that can be downloaded from [population.xlsx](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Oq04wF-OZwsh1Y3aMBLTJCoxANgqYBVq/view?usp=sharing).

#### Step 2b:
Download the Excel file and open it in Excel.

Add an Assay:
- "Obtain metabolic model"

![Edited population file](../images/populating-project-guide-5.png)

Save the population file.

### Step 3: Uploading the Population File

#### Step 3a:
Click on "Data file" under the "Create" button.

![Start creating a Data file](../images/populating-project-guide-6.png)

#### Step 3b:
In the New Data file screen, you can upload the Excel file containing the ISA structure; select the "Local file" population spreadsheet that you just edited.

![Selecting the edited spreadsheet](../images/populating-project-guide-7.png)

When you click "Upload" a metadata screen is shown.

#### Step 3c:
Make sure to enter the title and description. Make sure the correct project (with your name) is selected.

![Uploading a Data file](../images/populating-project-guide-8.png)

Click "End" and then, on the next screen, "Create".

#### Step 3d:
Once finished, a sharing summary is shown.

By default, all data that is uploaded will remain hidden to the public â€” but obviously not to you.

Click "OK" and the Data file will be created.

### Step 4: Populating Your Project

#### Step 4a:
When uploading has finished, the data file page is shown with the information that you provided.

![Population file registered on the Hub](../images/populating-project-guide-11.png)

#### Step 4b:
On your project page, select "Populate Project" from the "Actions" menu.

![Choosing to populate the project](../images/populating-project-guide-12.png)

In the dropdown menu under Spreadsheet selection, select your Excel sheet and click "Populate". This will create the ISA structure for your project.

#### Step 4c:
Once the population is finished, the ISA structure from the Excel sheet is generated.

### Step 5: Editing Elements in the ISA Structure

If you check the names of the Assays, you will realize that "Identify enzymes from specta" should be called "Identify enzymes from spectra". Double-click on the assay in the tree.

#### Step 5a:
On the Assay's page select "Edit assay" from the "Actions" menu.

![Selecting to Edit the misspelled Assay](../images/populating-project-guide-15.png)

#### Step 5b:
Change the Title of the Assay and click "Update" at the bottom of the Edit page.

Now proceed to Section 3.
