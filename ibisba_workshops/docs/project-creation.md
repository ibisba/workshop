# Project Creation on the IBISBAKHub

## Step 1: Access the Hub
Go to [https://sandbox10.fairdomhub.org](https://sandbox10.fairdomhub.org) and "Log in" to your account.

## Step 2: Create a New Project
After logging in, click on the "*Create*" tab and from the pull-down menu select "*Project*". This will open a New Project page.

Fill in the sections using the following information:

### Title
*\<Your Name\> Project: An inventory of the Aspergillus niger secretome*

### Description
*Protein secretion usually requires the presence of a N-terminal signal peptide (SP) and by scanning for this feature using available highly accurate SP-prediction tools, the fraction of potentially secreted proteins can be directly predicted. We were able to improve the in silico inventory of Aspergillus niger secretory proteins by combining different gene-model predictions from neighbouring Aspergilli and thereby avoiding prediction conflicts associated with inaccurate gene-models. An experimental validation of the predicted proteome confirmed in silico predictions.*
